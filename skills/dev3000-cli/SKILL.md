# dev3000 CLI

Use this skill when you need to run or automate local developer workflows using
`vercel-labs/dev3000`.

## Workflow

1. Review upstream docs for installation and available commands.
2. Run the CLI from the repo root so any generated files stay in this project.
3. Document any new commands or conventions in `docs/skills.md`.

## References

- See `references/dev3000.md` for links and notes.
