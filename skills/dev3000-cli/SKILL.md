# dev3000 CLI

Use this skill when you need to run or automate local developer workflows using
`vercel-labs/dev3000`.

## Workflow

1. Use the helper scripts in `scripts/` to install or run dev3000:
   - `scripts/install-dev3000.sh`
   - `scripts/run-dev3000.sh`
2. Run from the repo root so generated files stay in this project.
3. Document any new commands or conventions in `docs/skills.md`.

## References

- See `references/dev3000.md` for links and notes.
