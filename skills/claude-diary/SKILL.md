# Claude Diary

Use this skill when you need to capture interaction traces or post-session
summaries using the `claude-diary` tool.

## Workflow

1. Review upstream docs for setup and required inputs.
2. Run the tool against the target session or logs.
3. Store outputs in the agreed repo location and link them in docs if needed.
