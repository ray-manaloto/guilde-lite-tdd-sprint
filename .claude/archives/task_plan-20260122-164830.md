# Task Plan: AI Self-Healing System Validation & Autonomous Hooks

## Goal
Validate the AI self-healing system is fully operational and implement autonomous operation enforcement via Claude Code hooks.

## Success Criteria
- [x] Self-healing status endpoint returns `enabled: true`
- [x] GitHub workflow pushed and triggerable
- [x] Autonomous hooks implemented (90%+ routine tasks without consultation)
- [x] CLAUDE.md files updated via claude-md-management plugin
- [x] End-to-end test passes
- [x] CLI health check system implemented

## Phases

### Phase 1: Requirements [COMPLETE]
- [x] Define autonomous workflow rules
- [x] Identify consultation triggers (secrets, restarts, critical decisions)
- [x] Research Claude Code hooks system

### Phase 2: Design [COMPLETE]
- [x] Design hooks architecture (ADR-002)
- [x] Create permission schemas
- [x] Design infrastructure integration

### Phase 3: Implementation [COMPLETE]
- [x] Update .claude/settings.json with autonomous permissions
- [x] Push workflow to GitHub (commit 3784150)
- [x] Backend restarted (self-healing now enabled: true)
- [x] Integrate claude-md-management for CLAUDE.md updates

### Phase 4: Quality [COMPLETE]
- [x] Test self-healing status endpoint
- [x] Test manual error trigger (classification works)
- [x] Verify autonomous hooks work
- [x] Run full end-to-end flow (all tests passed)

### Phase 5: Release [COMPLETE]
- [x] Update CLAUDE.md with autonomous operation rules
- [x] Document hook configuration (SDLC README updated)
- [x] Confirm operational status (enabled: true verified)
- [x] CLI health check and self-heal scripts created

## User Consultation Triggers
Only consult user for:
1. Config changes requiring secrets (API keys, tokens)
2. Service restarts requiring system access
3. Critical architectural decisions
4. Destructive operations (force push, database drops)

## Files to Create/Modify
- `.claude/settings.json` - Add autonomous permissions
- `CLAUDE.md` - Add autonomous operation rules
- `.github/workflows/ai-self-heal.yml` - Push to GitHub
