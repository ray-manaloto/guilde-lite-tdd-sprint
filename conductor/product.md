# Initial Concept
A sprint being triggered by a user and the webapp continuously follows the ai agentic flow until the software works, is validated and the user can either download and/or run the generated project/source code.

# Product Definition

## Target Users
- **Developers:** Looking for a robust AI boilerplate to kickstart projects with pre-integrated enterprise features.
- **Enterprise Teams:** Building internal AI assistants that require strict observability, security, and scalability.
- **Startups:** Aiming to ship high-quality AI products quickly by leveraging automated agentic workflows.

## Business Goals
- **Accelerate Development Cycles:** Dramatically reduce the time from concept to working software through automated AI sprints.
- **Ensure High Observability:** Provide a production-ready environment where every LLM interaction is traceable and measurable using Logfire and Prometheus.
- **Architectural Excellence:** Demonstrate and enforce best practices in full-stack AI application development, providing a reliable foundation for complex systems.

## Key Features
- **User-Triggered Automated Sprints:** A seamless experience where users initiate a development goal, and the system takes over.
- **Continuous Agentic Workflow:** An autonomous AI agent loop that handles coding, testing, and validation iteratively.
- **Software Validation & Delivery:** Automated verification ensuring the generated code meets standards, followed by options to download or immediately run the project.
- **Enterprise-Grade Infrastructure:** Built-in authentication, real-time WebSocket streaming, and comprehensive observability out of the box.

## Success Metrics
- **Time to Validation:** The average time taken from a user-triggered sprint to a validated, runnable piece of software.
- **Code Quality Score:** Success rate of generated code passing existing linting and testing suites on the first attempt.
- **User Adoption:** Frequency of sprint completions resulting in downloaded or deployed codebases.
