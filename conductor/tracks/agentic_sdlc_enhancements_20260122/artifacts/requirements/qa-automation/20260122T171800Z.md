# Requirements: QA Automation (qa-automation)

## Findings

- Hooks are best used to run fast, deterministic checks after edits; heavy tests
  should be moved to scheduled or gated workflows.

- E2E best practices emphasize stable selectors, user-behavior tests, and
  avoiding flakiness with explicit waits and page objects.

- Claude Code best practices emphasize giving the agent a way to verify work
  with tests and clear success criteria.

## Recommendations

- PR gate: smoke E2E for top critical flows (login, sprint creation, plan run).
- Nightly: full E2E suite (multi-browser optional), visual/a11y checks.
- Integration tests: no mocks/patch fixtures; ensure DB + services up.
- Add data-testid attributes for stable UI selectors.
- Use Playwright traces/snapshots for flaky failures.
