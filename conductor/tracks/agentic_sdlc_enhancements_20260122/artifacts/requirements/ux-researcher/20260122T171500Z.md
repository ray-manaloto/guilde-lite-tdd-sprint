# Requirements: UI/UX Role Integration (ux-researcher)

## Findings

- Claude Code best practices emphasize explicit verification criteria and
  user-centered outcomes; UI/UX roles should own user journey validation and
  acceptance criteria for critical flows (login, planning interview, sprint
  execution). Source: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/best-practices
- E2E testing patterns recommend using behavior-focused tests, stable selectors
  (data-testid), and accessibility validation to catch regressions early.

  (pattern guidance) and e2e-testing patterns (Playwright).

## SDLC Role Recommendations

- Requirements: UX researcher defines user journeys and UX acceptance criteria.
- Design: UX researcher validates flows and interaction patterns; collaborates
  with interaction designer and accessibility specialist.
- Quality: UX QA validates flows in smoke E2E suite; a11y checks included.

## Deliverables

- UX journey map + critical flow checklist per track.
- UX acceptance criteria stored in Conductor artifacts.
- A11y checklist integrated into QA phase.
