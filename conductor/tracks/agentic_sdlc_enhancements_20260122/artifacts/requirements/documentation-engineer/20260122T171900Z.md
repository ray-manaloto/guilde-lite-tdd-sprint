# Requirements: Documentation Synchronization (documentation-engineer)

## Findings

- Hooks enable deterministic quality checks and automation; use PostToolUse for
  doc sync and Stop/SubagentStop to enforce completion checks.

- Complete workflows combine custom commands, hooks, and subagents to keep
  docs and code aligned throughout the SDLC.

- Claude Code best practices emphasize context hygiene and recoverability using
  /compact and session management.

## Recommendations

- Run documentation-engineer subagent in parallel on every phase.
- Add SessionEnd hook to snapshot:
  - git status + diff summary
  - current Conductor plan task markers
  - last commands/run outputs
- Add SessionStart hook to restore summary and reopen plan-of-record.
- Add PreCompact hook to write a short recovery note in Conductor artifacts.
- Add slash commands for `/sync-docs`, `/sync-plan`, `/recovery-status`.
