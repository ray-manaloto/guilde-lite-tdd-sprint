## Recommendations

- Add project commands:
  - `/feature-start`, `/feature-complete`, `/qa-smoke`, `/sync-docs`
- Add PostToolUse hooks:
  - Lint/format on file edits
  - Quick unit test on modified modules
- Add PreToolUse hooks:
  - Block edits to sensitive files (env/secrets)
- Add Stop/SubagentStop hooks:
  - Ensure tests run before final response
- Recommend MCP servers:
  - context7 (library docs)
  - github (issues/PRs)
  - playwright (UI testing)
