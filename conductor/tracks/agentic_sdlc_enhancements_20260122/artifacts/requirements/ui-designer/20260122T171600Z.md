# Requirements: UI Design Integration (ui-designer)

## Findings

- Best practices encourage verification loops; for UI this implies visual checks
  and clear design specs to enable deterministic implementation.

- E2E patterns recommend visual regression tests and accessibility audits as
  quality gates for UI changes.

## SDLC Role Recommendations

- Design: UI designer owns layout, visual hierarchy, and design token updates.
- Implement: UI/UX engineers may implement design updates directly.
- Quality: Add visual regression snapshots for critical UI surfaces.

## Deliverables

- Design spec or annotated screenshots for target screens.
- Design token updates (colors/typography/spacing).
- Visual regression artifacts for key views.
