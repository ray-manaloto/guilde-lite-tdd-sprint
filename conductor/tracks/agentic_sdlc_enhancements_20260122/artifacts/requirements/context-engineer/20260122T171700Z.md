# Requirements: Context Engineering (context-engineer)

## Findings

- Claude Code best practices stress aggressive context management, explicit
  verification criteria, and use of subagents for investigation.

- Agentic systems should use simple workflow patterns (prompt chaining,
  parallelization, routing) before over-complicated autonomy.

- Orchestrator-workers pattern supports dynamic role selection for complex tasks.

- Evaluator-optimizer loop improves output quality with structured feedback.

- Prompt caching reduces latency and cost for repeated context blocks.

## Recommendations

- Introduce tiered context:
  - Core: Conductor context + CLAUDE.md equivalents
  - Task: current track spec/plan
  - Transient: recent file diffs + test output
- Add PreCompact hook to summarize recent work into Conductor artifacts.
- Use evaluator-optimizer loops for plan/spec validation when confidence is low.
- Use orchestrator-workers for dynamic role assignment when tasks diverge.
- Consider prompt caching for repeated planning templates.
