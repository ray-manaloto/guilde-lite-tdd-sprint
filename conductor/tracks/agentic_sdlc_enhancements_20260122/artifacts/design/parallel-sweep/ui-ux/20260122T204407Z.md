## Design Decisions
- **Parallel agent workflow for UI/UX:**  
  - UI Designer agent prepares visual specs + tokens while UX Researcher agent defines journeys/acceptance criteria in parallel.  
  - Accessibility Specialist agent validates WCAG criteria and prepares audit checklist.  
  - UI/UX Lead reconciles outputs into a single Phase 2 design packet.
- **Context-first design artifacts:**  
  - Maintain a `DESIGN_CONTEXT.md` (auto-loaded by agents) with design principles, target users, component library links, and “do/don’t” patterns.  
  - Persist decisions in `NOTES_UX.md` for context recovery across agent runs.
- **Verification loops:**  
  - Every screen/flow spec has a “verification checklist” to enable evaluator agents to confirm UI parity and UX outcomes.
- **Deterministic implementation guidance:**  
  - Provide annotated screenshots/wireframes + explicit tokens and spacing, reducing ambiguity for implementation agents.

## Deliverables
**UX Researcher**
- User journey map with critical flows (login, planning interview, sprint execution).
- UX acceptance criteria per flow (stored in Conductor artifacts).
- Critical flow checklist for smoke E2E suite (selectors + expected behaviors).

**UI Designer**
- Annotated high-fidelity screen specs (with layout, spacing, component states).
- Updated design tokens (color, typography, spacing, elevation).
- Component state matrix (default/hover/focus/error/loading).

**Accessibility Specialist**
- A11y checklist (WCAG 2.1 AA) mapped to each flow.
- Focus order + keyboard navigation map for critical screens.
- ARIA and semantic markup guidance.

**Shared Artifacts**
- `DESIGN_CONTEXT.md` (design principles + target users + references).
- `NOTES_UX.md` (decisions, rationale, risks).
- Visual regression baselines for key views.

## Gates
1. **UX Acceptance Gate (Phase 2 exit):**  
   - All critical journeys have acceptance criteria and verification steps.  
2. **A11y Gate (Pre-implementation):**  
   - A11y checklist completed + violations documented.  
3. **Visual Consistency Gate (Pre-merge):**  
   - Visual regression snapshots approved for key surfaces.  
4. **E2E Smoke Gate (PR):**  
   - UX-critical flows pass behavior-focused tests using stable selectors (`data-testid`).  
5. **Nightly QA Gate:**  
   - Full suite including a11y audits and visual regression runs.

---

## Risks/Dependencies
- **Dependency on stable component library:** UI specs may drift if tokens/components change mid-sprint.
- **Agent context loss:** Without context files, agents may diverge on design decisions.
- **A11y compliance risk:** Late accessibility review may force redesign of UI patterns.
- **E2E fragility:** Unstable selectors or ambiguous flows can cause flaky smoke tests.
- **Tooling dependency:** Visual regression and a11y automation require pipeline readiness.

## Open Questions
- Who owns long-term maintenance of `DESIGN_CONTEXT.md` and `NOTES_UX.md`?
- What is the minimum required scope for visual regression snapshots (all critical flows vs. top 5 surfaces)?
- Which screens are designated “no-regression” and must always pass a11y audits before merge?
- How strict should the UX Acceptance Gate be for experimental/low-risk features?
- How will we validate evaluator agents to avoid rubber-stamping UX defects?
