### Design Decisions
- Use Conductor `spec.md/plan.md` as canonical UI intent; ExecPlan only *extends* with UI/UX-specific acceptance + validation details (no restating full spec).
- ExecPlan “UI Milestones” are narrative steps that explain interaction flow, visual hierarchy, states, and accessibility intent in plain language for a novice implementer.
- Acceptance criteria must be observable UI behavior (e.g., “Empty state shows CTA and explanation; keyboard focus visible on primary action; error state copy visible after failed submit”).
- Validation gates include lightweight evidence capture (screenshots, DOM/ARIA checks, interaction recordings) and explicit commands (storybook/tests/manual steps) to verify UI outcomes.

### Deliverables
- **Conductor**: `spec.md` with UI intent (user journeys, key screens, accessibility requirements), `plan.md` with implementation approach.
- **ExecPlan**: Adds:
  - UI/UX acceptance bullets per milestone (observable outcomes).
  - Validation steps with commands + expected outputs (e.g., “`pnpm test:ui` ⇒ all pass; manual keyboard tab order verified”).
  - UI state matrix (empty/loading/error/success) summarized in prose.
  - Evidence checklist (screenshots, a11y audit artifacts) in Progress section only.

### Gates
- **Spec Gate**: UI intent clearly described in `spec.md` (screens, flows, critical states, a11y goals).
- **Plan Gate**: `plan.md` includes UI build strategy and component ownership.
- **ExecPlan Gate**:
  - Acceptance criteria are observable (no “should feel…”).
  - Validation steps are explicit and repeatable.
  - Evidence capture listed and produced.
- **Verification Gate**: Demonstrate outcomes with artifacts (screenshots + a11y check) and link them in Outcomes & Retrospective.

### Risks/Dependencies
- Risk of duplication between `spec.md` and ExecPlan. Mitigate by referencing spec sections; only add validation/acceptance in ExecPlan.
- Dependency on design system tokens/components; ensure plan calls out component availability or need for new tokens.
- Accessibility validation depends on tooling (axe/playwright); ensure commands are available and documented.

### Open Questions
- What is the minimum UI evidence set acceptable for verification (screenshots only vs. plus a11y audit)?
- Which UI validation commands are standardized across repos (storybook/test suites)?
- Who owns final UX copy verification (PM/design vs. engineer) and where is that documented?
