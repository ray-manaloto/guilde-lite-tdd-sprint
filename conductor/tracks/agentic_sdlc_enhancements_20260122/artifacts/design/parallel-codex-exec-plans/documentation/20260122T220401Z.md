## Design Decisions
- **ExecPlan as doc-sync addendum:** Create `docs/execplans/<feature>.md` only for work meeting AGENTS.md threshold (multi-hour, cross-cutting, or refactor). It complements—not replaces—`spec.md`/`plan.md` (Conductor artifacts remain canonical).
- **Minimal duplication rule:** ExecPlan references relevant spec/plan sections by ID/anchor and embeds only missing operational details required by PLANS.md (commands, expected outputs, validation steps, evidence capture).
- **Lifecycle alignment:** ExecPlan is produced after `plan.md` is approved and before implementation; updates happen during implementation and verification, with a final outcomes/retrospective section to feed back into `spec.md`/`plan.md` if changes occurred.
- **Single fenced block format:** ExecPlan content always delivered as a single fenced Markdown block, prose-first, with checklists only in Progress. No nested fences.

## Deliverables
- `AGENTS.md` update: criteria for when to require an ExecPlan (complex features/refactors, multi-hour tasks, high-risk changes).
- `PLANS.md` snippet: how to reference Conductor artifacts and enforce “no external docs” by embedding required knowledge.
- ExecPlan template file (in repo): sections for Progress, Surprises & Discoveries, Decision Log, Outcomes & Retrospective, plus narrative milestones and explicit validation steps.
- Doc-sync checklist: steps for updating `spec.md`/`plan.md` when ExecPlan outcomes diverge.

## Gates
- **Plan Gate:** ExecPlan required only if AGENTS.md criteria met; must cite `spec.md`/`plan.md` sections.
- **Implement Gate:** Implementation cannot start until ExecPlan includes explicit commands, expected outputs, and validation steps.
- **Verify Gate:** Evidence captured in ExecPlan (logs, screenshots, test outputs) and `plan.md` updated if scope/decisions changed.

## Risks/Dependencies
- Risk of duplication drift if ExecPlan repeats spec/plan content; mitigated by reference-first policy.
- Dependency on Conductor artifacts being stable and linkable (anchors or section IDs).
- Potential workflow friction if ExecPlan required too broadly; mitigate via clear AGENTS.md thresholds.

## Open Questions
- Where should ExecPlans live in repo (`docs/execplans/` vs `plans/execplans/`) to align with Conductor conventions?
- Do we require ExecPlan IDs to map to Conductor artifact IDs for traceability?
- Should doc-sync updates be mandatory for any change in acceptance criteria discovered during implementation?
