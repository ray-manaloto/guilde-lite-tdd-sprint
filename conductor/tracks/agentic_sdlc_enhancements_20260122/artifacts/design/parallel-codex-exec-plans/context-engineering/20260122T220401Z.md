## Design Decisions
- Treat **plan.md** as the ExecPlan when work exceeds a single sitting or spans multiple contributors; avoid a separate ExecPlan file to minimize duplication.
- Update **AGENTS.md** to codify the trigger: “Use ExecPlan (plan.md) for complex features/refactors or >2h tasks; otherwise short Plan section in spec.md is sufficient.”
- Align **plan.md** structure to PLANS.md requirements (Progress checkboxes, Surprises & Discoveries, Decision Log, Outcomes & Retrospective) and keep it **self‑contained** with any knowledge needed to execute.
- Keep **spec.md** as the concise, canonical requirement source; **plan.md** references spec.md but embeds any operational details needed to execute without external docs.
- Enforce single fenced block formatting for plan.md content if required by Conductor; no nested fences.

## Deliverables
- AGENTS.md update: explicit ExecPlan usage criteria, formatting rules, and validation evidence expectations.
- plan.md template aligned with PLANS.md (including required sections, acceptance/validation guidance, idempotent steps).
- Optional: lightweight checklist in CONTRIBUTING or README summarizing ExecPlan rules (no new process doc).

## Gates
- **Spec Gate:** spec.md reviewed; acceptance criteria observable.
- **Plan Gate:** plan.md passes PLANS.md format checks (required sections, no nested fences, self‑contained).
- **Implementation Gate:** commands include expected outputs and evidence capture; retries are safe/idempotent.
- **Verification Gate:** validation steps executed; results recorded in Outcomes & Retrospective.

## Risks/Dependencies
- Risk of duplication between spec.md and plan.md if plan embeds too much; mitigate by embedding only execution‑critical context.
- Requires Conductor expectations on fenced block formatting; verify current repo conventions.
- Team adoption risk; requires brief onboarding via AGENTS.md.

## Open Questions
- Should plan.md always be the ExecPlan, or only when triggered (complexity threshold)?
- Do we need automated linting to enforce PLANS.md format/sections?
- Are Conductor artifacts strictly single‑file (spec.md/plan.md) or do we allow an ExecPlans/ directory?
