### Design Decisions
- Treat `plan.md` (Conductor) as the canonical test strategy container; reference ExecPlan only when scope is multi-hour or high-risk and ensure it embeds all QA-relevant knowledge (no external doc links).
- Align QA milestones to PLANS.md: narrative milestones, observable acceptance, mandatory validation steps, and explicit command + expected output + evidence capture.
- Use ExecPlan Progress checklists only for QA progress tracking; keep prose-first sections elsewhere.
- Encode idempotent/safe retry guidance for test runs (e.g., cleanup steps, stable fixtures) directly in plan/ExecPlan.

### Deliverables
- **QA Test Strategy section in `plan.md`**: required test types, data/fixture strategy, environments, and validation commands with expected outputs.
- **QA Gate checklist**: acceptance criteria mapped to observable behavior and evidence artifacts (logs, screenshots, reports).
- **Optional ExecPlan (when triggered)**: includes QA milestones, validation steps, and rollback/cleanup guidance.

### Gates
- **Spec Gate**: `spec.md` includes testability notes and observable acceptance criteria.
- **Plan Gate**: `plan.md` includes executable validation steps + expected outputs; idempotence and cleanup documented.
- **Implement Gate**: tests added/updated in repo with deterministic fixtures.
- **Verify Gate**: run commands recorded with evidence; failures triaged and linked to decision log.

### Risks/Dependencies
- **Risk**: Duplication between plan.md and ExecPlan. **Mitigation**: ExecPlan only when required; point to plan.md for canonical strategy and keep ExecPlan self-contained for execution details.
- **Dependency**: Conductor artifacts must be updated before QA begins; lack of concrete acceptance criteria blocks test design.
- **Risk**: Non-deterministic tests without fixtures; **Mitigation**: mandate fixture creation and cleanup in validation steps.

### Open Questions
- What threshold qualifies a change as “multi-hour/high-risk” requiring an ExecPlan for QA?
- Are there standard evidence artifacts expected per test type (e.g., junit xml, screenshots)?
- Which environments are mandatory for QA validation (local, CI, staging)?
