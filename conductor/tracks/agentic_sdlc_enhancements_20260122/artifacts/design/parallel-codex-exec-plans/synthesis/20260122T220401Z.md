# Adoption Report — Unified Recommendation

## Recommended workflow changes
- **Keep `spec.md` canonical for requirements/UI intent**; include user journeys, key screens/states, accessibility goals, and observable acceptance criteria.
- **Use `plan.md` as the ExecPlan when complexity threshold is met** (multi‑hour, cross‑cutting, refactor/high‑risk). Make it self‑contained with required PLANS.md sections: Progress (checkboxes only), Surprises & Discoveries, Decision Log, Outcomes & Retrospective.
- **Make acceptance criteria observable and testable** (no subjective language).  
- **Require explicit validation steps** with commands + expected outputs and evidence capture (screenshots, a11y checks, logs).  
- **Ensure idempotent execution**: include cleanup/fixture guidance for safe retries.  
- **Avoid duplication**: `plan.md` references `spec.md` for intent; only add execution‑critical details.

## Where to place artifacts (Conductor vs ExecPlan)
- **Conductor (canonical):**
  - `spec.md`: requirements, UI intent, flows, critical states, a11y goals, acceptance criteria.
  - `plan.md`: implementation approach, QA strategy, validation commands + expected outputs, idempotence/cleanup, ownership.
- **ExecPlan (only when triggered):**
  - **Use `plan.md` itself** as the ExecPlan (no separate file). It must be self‑contained and follow PLANS.md format, with narrative milestones and explicit validation/evidence steps.

## Do‑not‑adopt items (conflicts with Conductor)
- **Do not create separate ExecPlan files** under `docs/execplans/` or other directories. This conflicts with keeping Conductor artifacts canonical and increases duplication drift.
- **Do not restate full spec content in the ExecPlan**; reference `spec.md` sections instead.

## Next steps
1. **Update `AGENTS.md`** with ExecPlan trigger criteria (multi‑hour, cross‑cutting, refactor/high‑risk) and formatting rules (single fenced block if required, no nested fences).
2. **Align `plan.md` template** to PLANS.md with required sections and explicit validation/evidence expectations.
3. **Add a QA Test Strategy section** to `plan.md` (fixtures, environments, commands, expected outputs, cleanup).
4. **Define minimum UI evidence set** (e.g., screenshots + a11y check) and standard validation commands per repo.
5. **Clarify ownership of UX copy verification** and document where it is tracked (spec vs plan).
