# Design Notes (documentation-engineer)

## Goals
- Keep code, Conductor artifacts, and docs in sync.
- Provide deterministic recovery after terminal crashes.
- Reduce drift between plan/spec and implementation.

## Workflow
1. **Before implementation**
   - Confirm active track `spec.md` + `plan.md` are current.
   - Record source-of-truth docs (e.g., `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/testing.md`).
2. **During implementation**
   - For every code change, log impacted docs in a running checklist.
   - Update Conductor plan markers with each completed task.
3. **After implementation**
   - Update docs in the same batch as code changes.
   - Ensure env/config changes are reflected in README and example env files.

## Sync Checklist
- `conductor/tracks/<id>/spec.md` updated with design or behavior changes.
- `conductor/tracks/<id>/plan.md` updated with status markers.
- Project docs updated for:
  - New commands/flags
  - New hooks/automation
  - QA gate changes
- If applicable: update runbooks or workflows.

## Crash Recovery
- Write session state to:
  - `conductor/tracks/<id>/artifacts/state/<timestamp>.md`
  - Include: last task, current branch, pending verifications, next steps.
- On restart:
  - Load latest state + core context.
  - Verify tasks in plan align with git status.

## Automation Recommendations
- Add a hook to warn if plan/spec changed without corresponding doc updates.
- Add a periodic check (manual or nightly) to diff doc references vs code paths.
