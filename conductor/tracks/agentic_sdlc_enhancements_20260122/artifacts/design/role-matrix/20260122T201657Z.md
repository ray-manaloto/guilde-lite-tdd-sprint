# Design Notes (role-matrix)

## Purpose
Define SDLC role coverage and deliverables for a parallel agentic workflow.

## Role Matrix by Phase

### Requirements
- Roles: product-lead, ux-researcher, context-engineer, qa-automation, documentation-engineer
- Deliverables:
  - Research artifacts per role under `artifacts/requirements/<role>/`.
  - Open questions + risks list in track spec.
  - Context tier inventory + required inputs for planning.
- Gates:
  - Research digest present.
  - Requirements artifacts exist for each role.

### Design
- Roles: ui-designer, interaction-designer, accessibility-specialist, systems-architect, documentation-engineer
- Deliverables:
  - Role matrix + UX acceptance criteria.
  - Context-engineering flow (tiers, compaction, recovery).
  - Documentation sync workflow with checklists.
  - Hook strategy for deterministic checks.
- Gates:
  - Phase 2 design artifacts under `artifacts/design/`.
  - Spec updated with design decisions.

### Implement
- Roles: frontend-engineer, ux-engineer, backend-engineer, devex-automation
- Deliverables:
  - Code changes with tests.
  - Updated Conductor plan markers with commit SHAs.
  - CLI/tooling updates for automation.
- Gates:
  - Unit/integration tests pass locally.
  - Doc updates complete for touched areas.

### Quality
- Roles: qa-automation, ux-qa, a11y-auditor, test-engineer
- Deliverables:
  - Smoke E2E suite for PR gating.
  - Nightly full E2E schedule + report format.
  - UX/a11y audit checklist + fixes.
- Gates:
  - Smoke E2E green for PRs.
  - Nightly suite runs and reports archived.

### Release (Sequential)
- Roles: documentation-engineer, release-manager, observability-analyst
- Deliverables:
  - Final docs (workflow, hooks, runbooks).
  - Track metadata updated + changelog entries.
  - Observability notes + cost/usage summaries.
- Gates:
  - Conductor acceptance criteria confirmed.
  - Release notes written and approved.

## Hand-off Rules
- Each role writes a timestamped artifact and state JSON.
- All phase gates reference artifact paths, not chat summaries.
- Human approvals required at phase boundaries.
