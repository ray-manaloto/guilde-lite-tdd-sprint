# Relevant Items
- **Agent:** `agents/doc-updater.md` (documentation sync agent) — purpose-built for keeping docs aligned with code changes.
- **Commands:** `commands/update-docs.md`, `commands/update-codemaps.md` — explicit doc-sync and codemap refresh entry points.
- **Hooks:** `hooks/hooks.json` blocks creation of random `.md`/`.txt` files outside `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`. This affects documentation workflows.
- **Memory/Context:** `hooks/memory-persistence/*` (session logs, compaction notes) and `skills/continuous-learning` (pattern extraction) can be leveraged to keep doc updates consistent over time.
- **Rules/Context:** `rules/*` + `contexts/*` and the repo’s recommended `CLAUDE.md` approach in examples.

# Recommended Adoption
1. **Adopt the `doc-updater` agent as a Conductor sub-agent**  
   Use it as a standard post-change task in Conductor (“Doc Sync” phase). This matches the Research Digest’s doc engineer role recommendation and keeps code/docs aligned without manual prompting.

2. **Add a Conductor command step using `/update-docs` + `/update-codemaps`**  
   Trigger these after implementation or before PR creation. This creates a reliable doc refresh checkpoint in the workflow.

3. **Integrate doc checks into Conductor gates**  
   Use an evaluator loop pattern: primary agent makes code changes, `doc-updater` reviews whether docs need updates. This mirrors the digest’s evaluator–optimizer loop for quality control.

4. **Standardize a `CLAUDE.md` reference for Conductor**  
   Use a project-level `CLAUDE.md` as the canonical doc “home” to align with the repo’s guidance and prevent context loss.

# Adaptation Notes
- **Hook compatibility:** The PreToolUse hook blocks creation of arbitrary `.md`/`.txt` files. For Conductor, either:
  - Whitelist your doc locations (e.g., `docs/`, `CHANGELOG.md`) in the matcher, or
  - Ensure `/update-docs` only edits `README.md` or allowed files.
- **Codemap usage:** If Conductor relies on a codemap, schedule `/update-codemaps` at the end of each run to keep it fresh.
- **Memory persistence:** Use `hooks/memory-persistence/session-end.sh` to capture doc-update reminders in session logs so doc sync is reloaded next session.

# Risks/Dependencies
- **Doc creation blocked by hooks:** The default hook prevents new documentation files; this can silently block Conductor if it tries to add docs in new locations.
- **Over-updating docs:** Without clear doc targets, `doc-updater` may make broad edits to `README.md`, risking noise or scope creep.
- **Tooling dependency:** `/update-docs` and `/update-codemaps` need to exist in Conductor’s command set; ensure they are enabled/installed if using plugin install.

# Open Questions
- What is the **canonical documentation surface** for Conductor (README only, docs/ tree, changelog)?
- Should doc updates be **mandatory gates** before PR creation, or advisory (optional)?
- Do we want a **separate Conductor doc-sync agent role** (doc engineer) or reuse `doc-updater` as-is?
