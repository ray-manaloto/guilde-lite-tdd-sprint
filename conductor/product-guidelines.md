# Product Guidelines

## Tone and Voice
- **Professional & Technical:** Use direct, efficient, and precise language. Avoid fluff or overly conversational fillers.
- **Clarity over Brevity:** While being concise is important, ensure technical accuracy and completeness are never sacrificed.
- **Authoritative & Reliable:** Communicate with confidence, reflecting the "Production-Ready" nature of the application.

## Visual Identity & UI/UX
- **Clean & Minimalist:** Prioritize clarity and readability. Use whitespace effectively to separate technical components and data streams.
- **Functional Aesthetic:** Design choices should serve a purpose (e.g., highlighting tool calls, status changes, or errors) rather than being purely decorative.
- **Consistency:** Maintain a unified look across the chat interface, admin panel, and documentation.

## Brand Messaging
- **"Production-Ready AI":** Consistently reinforce that the platform provides a robust foundation for building enterprise-grade AI applications.
- **Trust through Transparency:** Leverage the integrated observability (Logfire) as a core value proposition—users can trust the AI because they can see exactly how it works.

## Documentation & Code Style
- **Self-Documenting Code:** Use expressive naming conventions and modular architecture. Comments should explain *why* something is done, rather than *what* is being done.
- **Consistency:** Adhere strictly to the project's established linting and formatting standards (Ruff, Prettier) to ensure the codebase remains maintainable.

## Iterative Improvement
- **Automated Quality Assurance:** Utilize the built-in LLM-based "judge" flow to continuously audit and improve agent responses and tool usage.
- **Data-Driven Evolution:** Use performance metrics and trace data to guide the roadmap and optimize the core agentic workflows.
