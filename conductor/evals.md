# Evals and Verification

## Purpose

Use evals to measure correctness, regression risk, and workflow quality.

## Minimum Gates

- Integration tests pass.
- Critical paths have explicit acceptance criteria.
- Failures trigger re-planning or additional clarification.

## Review Loop

- Add reviewer/fixer loops for high-risk changes.
- Use structured outputs to record findings and confidence.

## Improvement Loop

- Track repeated failures and update planning prompts or guardrails.
- Use judge evaluations for ambiguous outputs where possible.
